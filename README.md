# Web Engineer Challenge - Summer 2019

Build a web app to search for waste items using the Toronto Waste Wizard database, and save frequently used ones.

## Instructions
- Reproduce the design as provided in the screenshot, which displays example search results.
- The data must be taken from the [Waste Wizard Lookup data (JSON)](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#5ed40494-a290-7807-d5da-09ab6a56fca2).
- Typing in the search field should *NOT* perform an API call.
- A search must be performed when hitting enter or clicking the search button.
- When the search input field is cleared, the list of results should also be cleared. 
- Performing a search should render a list of potential matching items based on keywords. Each item should:
   - Render the title and description of the item.
   - Render a grey star button *if the item is not already favourited*.
   - Render a green star icon *if the item is not already favourited*.
   - Clicking the star button should add the item to the favourites list.
- When the number of favourites is more than one, the app should render a list of items. Each saved item should:
   - Render the title and description of the item.
   - Render a green star button *if the item has been favourited*.
   - Clicking the green star button should remove the item from the saved list.

# Web Challenge

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
